def calculate_final_grade(accuracy_percent: float, processing_time_sec: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the final grade based on license plate OCR accuracy and pro
    cessing time.
    Parameters:
    - accuracy_percent: OCR accuracy as a percentage (0–100)
    - processing_time_sec: total time to process 100 images in seconds
    Returns:
    - Grade on a scale from 2.0 to 5.0 (rounded to the nearest 0.5)
